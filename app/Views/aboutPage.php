                        <p class="about-text text-black">Cebu Pacific first took to the skies on March 8, 1996, flying from Manila to its hometown Cebu. It has since been committed to flying where Filipinos are - from its first international flight to Hong Kong back in 2001 to its first low-cost long-haul flight to Dubai in 2013.</p>
                        <p class="about-text text-black">In 2008, CEB received its first ATR 72-500, boosting inter-island connections and expanding to have the widest network in the Philippines. The airline also consistently made flying accessible for everyJuan through promo fares and its trademark Piso Sale, which it pioneered back in 2004.</p>
                        <p class="about-text text-black">The airline also took part in numerous passenger events, including the surprise announcement of its 200 millionth passenger in Cebu last March 2022 and the milestone of reaching USD 1 million in donations for UNICEF's Change for Good program in 2019. The collected amount supported children in marginalized communities in the Philippines.</p>
                        <p class="about-text text-black">In line with its sustainability and eco-friendly initiatives, CEB took delivery of its first Airbus A321neo in 2019, and A330neo in 2021. This shift to a more fuel-efficient neo engine aircraft paves the way to having an all neo fleet by 2027 and supports the airline's commitment to ensure environmental and social sustainability while making air travel reliable and accessible for all.</p>
